# Stage 1: Build the frontend
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if available) first to leverage caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the frontend source code
COPY . .

# Run the build command
RUN npm run build

# Optional: Verify the build output (for debugging)
RUN ls -la /app/dist

# Stage 2: Serve the frontend using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Remove default Nginx static assets
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

# Copy the build output to Nginx's default directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx when the container launches
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
